# Feren Storium
Modular Package Management Backend using a combination of a desired GUI and HTML

This is essentially going to be the base of New Feren OS Store with the goal of letting Feren OS Store exist to its full goals and full potential, but also allow the codebase to individually be contributed to and be adapted by others across the Linux space, with modularity in mind.


As such, this will essentially eventually be the New Feren OS Store but stripped of its GUI principles and pages and essentially turned back into a tech demonstration to be adapted upon.
